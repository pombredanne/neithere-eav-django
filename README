EAV-Django
==========

EAV-Django is a reusable Django application which provides an implementation of
the Entity-Attribute-Value data model.

    Entity-Attribute-Value model (EAV), also known as object-attribute-value
    model and open schema which is used in circumstances where the number of
    attributes (properties, parameters) that can be used to describe a thing (an
    "entity" or "object") is potentially very vast, but the number that will
    actually apply to a given entity is relatively modest.

(See the `Wikipedia article <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity-attribute-value_model>`_
for more details.)

EAV-Django works fine with traditional RDBMS (tested on SQLite and MySQL).

Priorities
----------

The application grew from an online shop project, so it is pretty practical and
not just an academic exercise. The main priorities were:

a) flexibility of data,
b) efficiency of queries, and
c) maximum maintainability without editing the code.

Of course this implies trade-offs, and the goal was to find the least harmful
combination for the general case.

Features
--------

All provided models are abstract, i.e. EAV-Django does not store any information
in its own tables. Instead, it provides a basis for your own models which will
have support for EAV out of the box.

The EAV API includes:

* *Create/update/access:* model instances provide standart API for both "real"
  fields and EAV attributes. The abstraction, however, does not stand in your
  way and provides means to deal with the underlying stuff.
* *Query:* BaseEntityManager includes uniform approach in `filter()` and
  `exclude()` to query "real" and EAV attributes.
* Customizable *schemata for attributes*.
* *Admin:* all dynamic attributes can be represented and modified in the Django
  admin with no or little effort (using `eav.admin.BaseEntityAdmin`). Schemata
  can be edited separately, as ordinary Django model objects.
* *Facets:* facet search is an important feature of online shops, catalogues,
  etc. Basically you will need a form representing a certain subset of model
  attributes with appropriate widgets and choices so that the user can choose
  desirable values of some properties, submit the form and get a list of
  matching items. In general case django-filter would do, but it won't work
  with EAV, so EAV-Django provides a complete set of tools for that.

Examples
--------

Let's define an EAV-friendly model, create an EAV attribute and see how it
behaves. By "EAV attributes" I mean those stored in the database as separate
objects but accessed and searched in such a way as if they were columns in the
entity's table:

.. code-block:: python

    from django.db import models
    from eav.models import BaseEntity, BaseSchema, BaseAttribute

    class Fruit(BaseEntity):
        title = models.CharField(max_length=50)

    class Schema(BaseSchema):
        pass

    class Attr(BaseAttribute):
        schema = models.ForeignKey(Schema, related_name='attrs')

    # in Python shell:

    # define attribute named "colour"
    >>> colour = Schema.objects.create(
    ...     title = 'Colour',
    ...     name = 'colour',               # omit to populate/slugify from title
    ...     datatype = Schema.TYPE_TEXT
    ... )

    # create an entity
    >>> e = Fruit.objects.create(title='Apple', colour='green')

    # define "real" and EAV attributes the same way
    >>> e.title
    'Apple'
    >>> e.colour
    'green'

    >>> e.save()    # deals with EAV attributes automatically

    # list EAV attributes as Attr instances
    >>> e.attrs.all()
    [<Attr: Apple: Colour "green">]

    # search by an EAV attribute as if it was an ordinary field
    >>> Fruit.objects.filter(colour='yellow')
    [<Fruit: Apple>]

    # all compound lookups are supported
    >>> Fruit.objects.filter(colour__contains='yell')
    [<Fruit: Apple>]

Note that we can access, modify and query `colour` as if it was a true Entity
field, but at the same time its name, type and even existance are completely
defined by a Schema instance. A Schema object can be understood as a class, and
related Attr objects are its instances. In other words, Schema objects are like
CharField, IntegerField and such, only defined on data level, not hard-coded in
Python. And they can be "instantiated" for any Entity (unless you put custom
constraints which are outside of EAV-Django's area of responsibility).

The names of attributes are defined in related schemata. This can lead to fears
that once a name is changed, the code is going to break. Actually this is not
the case as names are only directly used for manual lookups. In all other cases
the lookups are constructed without hard-coded names, and the EAV objects are
interlinked by primary keys, not by names. The names are present if forms, but
the forms are generated depending on current state of metadata, so you can safely
rename the schemata. What you *can* break from the admin interface is the types.
If you change the data type of a schema, all its attributes will remain the same
but will use another column to store their values. When you restore the data type,
previously stored values are visible again.

You can find more examples in the source code: see directory "example/" and the
tests.

Data types
----------

Metadata-driven structure extends flexibility but implies some trade-offs. One
of them is increased number of JOINs (and, therefore, slower queries). Another
is fewer data types. Theoretically, we can support all data types available for
a storage, but in practice it would mean creating many columns per attribute
with just a few being used -- exactly what we were trying to avoid by using EAV.
This is why EAV-Django only supports some basic types (though you can extend
this list if needed):

* Schema.TYPE_TEXT, a TextField;
* Schema.TYPE_FLOAT, a FloatField;
* Schema.TYPE_DATE, a DateField;
* Schema.TYPE_BOOL, a NullBooleanField;
* Schema.TYPE_MANY for multiple choices (i.e. lists of values).

All EAV attributes are stored as records in a table with unique combinations of
references to entities and schemata. (Entity is referenced through the
contenttypes framework, schema is referenced via foreign key.) In other words,
there can be only one attribute with given entity *and* schema. The schema is a
definition of attribute. The schema defines name, title, data type and a number
of other properties which apply to any attribute of this schema. When we access
or search EAV attributes, the EAV machinery always uses schemata as attributes
metadata. Why? Because the attribute's name is stored in related schema, and
the value is stored in *a* column of the attributes table. We don't know which
column it is until we look at metadata.

In the example provided above we've only played with a text attribute. All other
types behave exactly the same except for TYPE_MANY. The many-to-many is a
special case as it involves an extra model for choices. EAV-Django provides an
abstract model but requires you to define a concrete model (e.g. Choice), and
point to it from the attribute model (i.e. put foreign key named "choice"). The
Choice model will also have to point at Schema. Check the tests for an example.

Documentation
-------------

Currently there is no tutorial.  Still, the code itself is rather
well-documented and the whole logic is pretty straightforward. 

Please see:

* tests_, as they contain good examples of model definitions and queries;
* the bundled example ("grocery shop", comes with fixtures);
* the `discussion group`_.

.. _discussion group: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/eav-django
.. _tests: https://eav-django.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference.html#tests

Dependencies
------------

In theory, Python 2.5 to 2.7 is supported; however, the library is only tested
against **Python 2.6 and 2.7**.

You'll also need **Django 1.1 or newer** and a couple of small libraries:
django_autoslug and django_view_shortcuts. This is usually handled
automatically by the installer.

Alternatives, Forks
-------------------

django-eav_
    A fork of eav-django that became a new app. Doesn't seem to be actively
    developed but is probably better in certain aspects. The original author
    of eav-django encourages users to give this app a try, too.
